The following program simulates a car with an alarm system. This projet uses a PHP script and a python program
to have an interaction between an android app and the server using JASON request. To simulate the car and the alarm
2 LEDs are connected to the breadboard, where LED1 is a switch that shows if the car ignition is on or off and LED2 will represent if an alarm is activated or not. 

The code is provided, aswell as screen shots of the program operating.
