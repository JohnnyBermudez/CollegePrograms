The following program is a continuation of part 1 and uses Kotlin to create an app for an android phone to simulate
a car with an intrustion system.

The application will have a swith for intrusion and ignition. Now, the LEDs on the breadboard should send a signal
to the server, and from the server to the application to show the switch representations in real time, and on
an android phone.

Changes to Part 1 include making a python program that syncs both the app data, and rpi data simultaneously.
